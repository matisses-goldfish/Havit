## Description:

How do I grow in my career? How can I improve my chances of securing stable income while working on something fun and alongside amazing people?

<br>

Even though the answer depends on your unique situation, there is a common thread, and it lies in your habits. In the classic book, The Coaching Habit, Michael Stanier says that to “build an effective new habit, you need five essential components: a reason, a trigger, a micro-habit, effective practice, and a plan.” As coders it's extremely important to stay healthy, balanced and happy. 

<br>

What we need are the 4 components: a trigger, a micro-habit, effective practice, and a plan.

### Havit Provides:
